This file provides the blue print of how the three neural networks was set up. 
The dataset of all the images of the turtles' heads are not in here as the files are too large. To see how the images of the turltles was uploaded, look at Network 1.
Network 2 and Network 3 are copies of the Network 1 with slight changes. 

Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wildlifedatasets/seaturtleidheads 

NOTE: Everytime you run the neural networks, there will be different accuracies. When the data is split into a training set and testing set, the images was picked randomly. This means that when you run the neural network everytime, it will select different images for the training and testing sets leading to differnet accuracies.
